Procedural Programming
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on procedures or functions that perform specific tasks. It is a set of step-by-step instruction = a function

OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
Organize our code into Objects

Why do we use OOP?
It tries to represent the real world
- Encapsulation: Hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world
- Inheritance: Creating a new object based on an existing object
- Polymorphism: The ability of an object to take on multiple forms
- Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world

Easy to create multiple objecrs

We can use a function to create/generate multple objects

Use PascalCase for things that generate objects/class: start every word with a capital
class = obj generator

OOP = organizing our code into objects (tries to represent the real world)
class = help us generate these object; basically class is an object generator

Features of class
1. Constructor = let us run setup code after creating an object; it let us put set up code inside the class & ehlp us make code look cleaner

SET UP CODE (SETUP this)

  this.localStorageKey = localStorageKey; // this will point to the object we will create let say object is businessCart then this will point businessCart
  this.loadFromStorage();// this will run the loadFromStorage function inside the class

More details about Constructor
1. It has to be named "constructor"
2. Should not return anything
