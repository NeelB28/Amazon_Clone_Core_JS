Procedural Programming
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on procedures or functions that perform specific tasks. It is a set of step-by-step instruction = a function

OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
Organize our code into Objects

Why do we use OOP?
It tries to represent the real world
- Encapsulation: Hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world
- Inheritance: Creating a new object based on an existing object
- Polymorphism: The ability of an object to take on multiple forms
- Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world

Easy to create multiple objecrs

We can use a function to create/generate multple objects

Use PascalCase for things that generate objects: start every word with a capital
