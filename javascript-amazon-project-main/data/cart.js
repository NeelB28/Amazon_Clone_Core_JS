// reason we created this is to keep code cleaner

// How do we know which product to add?
// For that we will learn about data attribute
// Data attribute is a way to store data in HTML elements which is another HTML attribute
// allows us to attach any info to an element
// name = value
// data-name = "value"
// it has to start with data-xyz (kebab-case format)
// so data-name will help to attach the name, price etc to the button element using data attributes

export const cart = [];
// now this variable can be used outside cart.js
